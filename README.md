This project simulates a zoo hospital where pets, horses, and wild animals receive treatment.

Here's a summary of the key aspects:

Animals: The simulation handles three types - pets, horses, and wild animals.

Treatments: Animals undergo regular checkups, potentially followed by surgery, medication, vaccines, or cosmetic treatments.

Resources: The hospital has limited resources like vets (regular and emergency), nurses, beds in the emergency room, and treatment rooms.

Trajectories: Each animal type follows a specific path through the hospital, considering resource availability and treatment needs. The code defines these paths with decision points.

Generators: The simulation generates animal arrivals at different times and frequencies.

Outputs: The code collects data on animal attributes (payment, time spent) and resource usage, allowing for calculating metrics like average wait time and cost per animal.

This simulation can help analyze hospital operations, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation for better animal care.
